This is a beginner project within the course "The Odin Project - Foundations" Wherein I will make a simple webpage involving recipes.

The webpage will consolidate my knowledge of HTML and HTML elements and provide a basic webpage to later style with CSS.

For now it will look fairly simple, and I will be improving as I go.
